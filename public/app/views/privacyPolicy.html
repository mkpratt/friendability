    <span class="title em">FRIENDABILITY PRIVACY POLICY</span>
    <br>
    <i>Last revised on: 8/16/2017</i>
    <br><br>
    Michael Johnson and team. (“Friendability” “we,” and “us”) respects the privacy of its users (“you”) and has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our application or services or transacting business with us. By using our website, application or other online services (our “Service”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    <br>
    If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.
    <br><br>
    <i>Information we collect about you</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        <span class="em">In General.</span>
        We may collect Personal Information, including Sensitive Data, and other information. “Personal Information” means individually identifiable information that would allow us to determine the actual identity of, and contact, a specific living person. Sensitive Data includes information, comments or content (e.g. photographs, profile, lifestyle) that you optionally provide that may reveal your ethnic origin, nationality, religion and/or sexual orientation. By providing Sensitive Data to us, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Sensitive Data as permitted by applicable privacy laws. We may also collect your geolocation information with your consent. We may collect this information through a website, mobile application, or other online services. By using the Service, you are authorizing us to gather, parse and retain data related to the provision of the Service. When you provide personal information through our Service, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and countries around the world.
        <br><br>
        <span class="em">Information you provide.</span>
        In order to register as a user with Friendability, you are asked a series of personality questions and provide a photo and name. You will also be asked to allow Friendability to collect your location information from your device when you use the “Nearby” feature of the Service. In addition, we may collect and store any personal information you provide while using our Service or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number. If you chat with other Friendability users, you provide us the content of your chats, and if you contact us with a customer service or other inquiry, you provide us with the content of that communication.
        <br><br>
        <span class="em">Use of technologies to collect information.</span>
        We use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities on our Service.
        <br><br>
        <span class="em">Information collected automatically.</span>
        We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit our Service. This information could include your IP address, device ID and type, your browser type and language, the operating system used by your device, access times, your mobile device’s geographic location while our application is actively running, and the referring website address.
        <br><br>
        <span class="em">Cookies and use of cookie and similar data.</span>
        When you visit our Service, we may assign your device one or more cookies or other technologies that facilitate personalization to facilitate access to our Service and to personalize your experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your activity on our Service, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits and the links you click. If we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our Service to show you Friendability advertisements on other sites or applications.
        <br><br>
        <span class="em">Mobile device IDs.</span>
        If you're using our app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Ad companies also use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.
        <br><br>
        <span class="em">Information collected by third-parties for advertising purposes.</span>
        We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our Service and elsewhere. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. We do not provide any non-masked or non-obscured personal information to third parties. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. Opting out will not decrease the number of advertisements you see.

    <br>
    <i>How we use the information we collect</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        <span class="em">In General.</span>
        We may use information that we collect about you to:
        deliver and improve our products and services, and manage our business;
        manage your account and provide you with customer support;
        perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our or others’ products, services, or content;
        communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or other third parties;
        develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Service and other sites, including providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites;
        website or mobile application analytics;
        enforce or exercise any rights in our Terms of Use; and
        perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>With whom we share your information</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        <span class="em">Information Shared with Other Users.</span>
        When you register as a user of Friendability, your Friendability profile will be viewable by other users of the Service. People will not, however, see your responses to any individual personality test question. If you tap on the chat Icon to say “yes” to a person, you will be able to chat with that person if they press the chat icon to say “yes” to you. If you chat with your match, of course your match will see the content of your chat.
        <br><br>
        <span class="em">Personal information.</span>
        We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:
        <br><br>
        <span class="em">Service providers.</span>
        We may share information, including personal and financial information, with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, ad tracking and analytics, member screenings, supporting our Service functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Service. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.
        <br><br>
        <span class="em">Other Situations.</span>
        We may disclose your information, including personal information:
        <br><br>
        <div class="indent">
            In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
            <br><br>
            When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies.
            <br><br>
            In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>Aggregated and/or non-personal information.</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        We may use and share non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with other third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Service and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis, advertising, marketing, or other business purposes. For example, we may engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. The cookies may reﬂect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. We may also share your geolocation information in de-identified form with third parties for the above purposes. 
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>Third-party websites</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        There are a number of places on our Service where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our Service, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third- party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the “privacy” link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>How you can access and correct your information</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        If you have a Friendability account, you have the ability to review and update your personal information within the Service by opening your account and going to settings. Applicable privacy laws may allow you the right to access and/or request the correction of errors or omissions in your personal information that is in our custody or under our control. Our Privacy Officer will assist you with the access request. This includes:
        <br><br>
        <div class="indent">
            Identification of personal information under our custody or control; and
            <br><br>
            Information about how personal information under our control may be or has been used by us.
        </div>
        <br>
        We will respond to requests within the time allowed by all applicable privacy laws and will make every effort to respond as accurately and completely as possible. Any corrections made to personal information will be promptly sent to any organization to which it was disclosed.
        In certain exceptional circumstances, we may not be able to provide access to certain personal information we hold. For security purposes, not all personal information is accessible and amendable by the Privacy Officer. If access or corrections cannot be provided, we will notify the individual making the request within 30 days, in writing, of the reasons for the refusal.
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>Data retention</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business or research purposes and as permitted by applicable legal requirements. If you close your account, we will retain certain data for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Service or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.
        <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>Your choices about collection and use of your information</i>
    <div class="indent">
        <br>
        You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Service because such information may be required in order for you to register as user.
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>How we protect your personal information</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
        You agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues, such as security breaches. We may post a notice on our Service if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. 
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>Information you provide about yourself while using our Service</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use.
    </div> 
    <br>
    <i>Children's privacy</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        Although our Service is a general audience Service, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under the age of 18.
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>Onward transfer and consent to international processing</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        We are a growing corporation with users and operations in multiple countries, including the European Union. We have developed data practices designed to assure information is appropriately protected but we cannot always know where personal information may be accessed or processed. While our primary data centers are in the United States, we may transfer personal information or other information to our offices outside of the United States. In addition, we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. If we disclose personal information to a third party or to our employees outside of the United States, we will seek assurances that any information we may provide to them is safeguarded adequately and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the requirements of applicable privacy laws.
        <br><br>
        <span class="em">
            If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal data, including sensitive data, by Friendability from your region to countries which do not have data protection laws that provide the same level of protection that exists in countries in the European Economic Area, including the United States. By providing your personal information, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.
        </span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>No Rights of Third Parties</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.
    </div>
    <br>
    <i>Changes to this Privacy Policy</i>
    <br><br>
    <div class="indent">
        We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Service, or advances in technology. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this policy will mean you consent to and accept those changes. If you do not consent to such changes you can delete your account in the Service.
